	<p class="salutation">Sirs,</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph">The ensuing Tract, I, many
	yeares since Translated out of
	the Originall <em>Spanish</em>, and
	Dedicated to the Right Honorable
	<em>Edward</em> Lord <em>Conway</em>,
	&amp;c. by whose Noble Patronage, the
	Confection whereof it Treats, together with
	it selfe, were first admitted into the <em>English</em>
	Court, where they received the Approbation
	of the most Noble and Iuditious those dayes
	afforded. Since which time, it hath beene
	universally sought for, and thirsted after
	by people of all Degrees (especially those of
	the Female sex) either for the Pleasure
	therein Naturally Residing, to Cure, and
	divert Diseases; Or else to supply some
	<!--Page iv-->Defects of Nature, wherein it chalenges
	a speciall Prerogative above all other
	Medicines whatsoever.</p>

	<p>The Author thereof was one <em>Antonio
	Colmenero</em> of <em>Ledesma</em>, who sometimes
	lived in the <em>West Indies</em>, where it is very
	much used, and held in great esteeme, untill
	this day; as also in <em>Spaine</em>, <em>Italy</em>, and
	<em>Flanders</em>, and admired by the most learned
	Doctors of all those Nations.</p>
	<p>As for the Name <em>[Chocolate]</em> it is an
	<em>Indian</em> word, compounded of <em>Ate</em> (as some
	say,) or (as others) <em>Atle</em>, which in the
	<em>Mexican Language</em>, signifieth <em>Water</em>; And
	<em>Choco</em>, the noise that the Water (wherein
	the <em>Chocolate</em> is put) maketh, when it is
	stirred in a Cup, untill it Bubble and rise
	unto a Froth:  And may be called in
	<em>English</em> A Compounded, or Confectioned
	drinke.</p>

	<p>The Confection it selfe, consists of severall
	Ingredients according to the different
	Constitutions of those that use it:  the Principall
	of which is called <em>Cacao</em>, [a kind of
	Nut, or kernell, bigger then a great Almond,
	which growes upon a tree called the
	<!--Page v--><a class="print_signature" id="signature_A4" title="A4"></a>Tree of <em>Cacao</em>] containing in it the Quality
	of the Foure Elements, as will appeare in
	the following Discourse.</p>

	<p>The vertues thereof are no lesse various,
	then Admirable. For, besides that it preserves
	Health, and makes such as drink it
	often, Fat, and Corpulent, faire and Amiable,
	it vehemently Incites to <em>Venus</em>, and
	causeth Conception in women, hastens and
	facilitates their Delivery: It is an excellent
	help to Digestion, it cures Consumptions,
	and the Cough of the Lungs, the
	New Disease, or Plague of the Guts, and
	other Fluxes, the Green Sicknesse, Jaundise,
	and all manner of Inflamations, Opilations,
	and Obstructions. It quite takes
	away the Morphew, Cleanseth the Teeth,
	and sweetneth the Breath, Provokes Urine,
	Cures the Stone, and strangury, Expells
	Poison, and preserves from all infectious
	Diseases.</p>

	<p>But I shall not assume to enumerate all
	the vertues of this Confection: for that
	were Impossible, every day producing New
	and Admirable effects in such as drinke it:
	I shall rather referre to the Testimony of
	<!--Page vi-->those Noble Personages who are known constantly
	to use and receive constant and manifold
	benefits by it, having hereby no other
	Aime then the Generall good of this
	Common-wealth (whereof I am a Faithfull
	Member) and to be esteemed (as really
	I am)</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph">The number is so great of
	those, who, in these times,
	drinke <em>Chocolate</em>, that not only
	in the <em>Indies</em>, where this
	kind of Drink hath its originall;
	but it is also much used in <em>Spain</em>, <em>Italy</em>
	and <em>Flanders</em>, and particularly at the
	Cour. And many doe speake diversly
	of it, according to the benefit, or hurt,
	they receive from it: Some saying, that
	it is stopping: Others, and those the greater
	part, that it makes one fat: Others,
	that the use of it strengthens the stomacke:
	Others, that it heates, and burns
	them: And others say, that although they
	take it every houre, and in the Dogdayes,
	yet they finde themselves well with it.
	And therefore my desire is, to take this
	paines, for the pleasure, and profit of the
	publicke; endeavouring to accommodate
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_2" title="2"></a>it to the content of all, according to the
	variety of those things, wherewith it may
	be mixt; that so every man may make
	choise of that, which shal be most agreeable
	to his disposition. I have not seene
	any, who hath written any thing, concerning
	this drinke; but onely a Physitian
	of <em>Marchena</em>, who (as it seemes) writ onely
	by Relation; holding an opinion, that
	the <em>Chocolate</em> is stopping, because that
	<em>Cacao</em> (the principall Ingredient of which
	it is made) is cold, and dry. But because
	this onely reason, may not have power to
	keepe some from the use of it, who are
	troubled with Opilations; I thinke fit to
	defend this <em>Confection</em>, with Philosophicall
	Reasons, against any whosoever will
	condemne this Drinke, which is so wholesome,
	and so good, knowing how to
	make the Paste in that manner, that it
	may be agreeable to divers dispositions,
	in the moderate drinking of it. And so,
	with all possible brevity, shall distinguish
	and divide this Treatise into foure poynts,
	or Heads. In the first place I shall declare,
	what <em>Chocolate</em> is; and what are

</div>
<div id="the_first_point" class="section">
	<h2 class="point_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page_4" title="4"></a>The first Point.</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph">Concerning the first Point, I say,
	that <em>Chocolate</em> is a name of the <em>Indians</em>;
	which in our vulgar Castilian,
	we may call a certaine <em>Confection</em>,
	in which (among the Ingredients) the
	principall <em>Basis</em>, and Foundation, is the
	<em>Cacao</em>; of whose Nature and Quality
	it is necessary first to treat: And therefore
	I say, according to the common <ins class="errata" id="errata_3" title="Original reads: re-received">received</ins>
	opinion, that it is cold, and dry,
	<i >à prædominio</i>; that is to say, that though
	it be true, that  every Simple containes in
	it the Qualities of the foure Elements, in
	the action, and re-action, which it hath
	in it, yet there results another distinct
	quality, which we call Complexion.</p>

	<p>This Quality or Complexion, which
	ariseth of this Mixture, is not alwayes
	one, and the same; neither hath it the
	effect in all the mixtures, but they may
	be varied nine wayes; four <em>Simple</em>, from
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_5" title="5"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_B3" title="B3"></a>whence one onely quality doth abound;
	and foure <em>Compounded</em>, from whence two
	Symbolizing qualities are predominant;
	and one other, which we call <i>ad
	pondus</i>, which is of all these fore-said
	qualities, which are in <i>æquilibrio</i>,
	that is to say, in equall measure and degree.</p>

	<p>Of all these the Complexion of <em>Cacao</em>
	is composed, since there arise two qualities,
	which are cold, and dry; and in the
	substance, that rules them, hath it <em>restringent</em>
	and <em>obstructive</em>, of the nature of the
	Element of the <em>Earth</em>. And then, as it is
	a Mixed, and not a simple Element, it
	must needs have parts correspondent to
	the rest of the Elements; and particularly,
	it partakees (and that, not a little) of
	those, which correspond with the Element
	of Aire, that is, Heat and Moysture,
	which are governed by the Unctious
	parts; there being drawne out of the
	<em>Cacao</em> much Butter, which, in the <em>Indies</em>
	I have seene drawne out if it, for the
	Face, by the <em>Criollas</em>.</p>

	<p>It may Philosophically be objected, in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_6" title="6"></a>this manner: <span class="reverse_emphasis">Two contrary Qualities, and
	Disagreeing, cannot be <em>in gradu intenso</em>,
	in one and the same Subject: <em>Cacao</em> is
	cold and drie, in predominency: Therefore,
	it cannot have the qualities contrary to those;
	which are Heat, and Moysture. The first Proposition
	is most certaine, and grounded upon
	good Philosophy: The second is consented
	unto, by all: The third, which is the Conclusion,
	is regular.</span></p>

	<p>It cannot be denyed, but that the <em>Argument</em>
	is very strong, and these reasons
	being considered by him of <em>Marchena</em>,
	have made him affirme, that <em>Chocolate</em> is
	Obstructive; it seeming to be contrary
	to Philosophy, that in it there should be
	found <em>Heat</em> and <em>Moysture</em>, <i>in gradu intenso</i>;
	and to be so likewise in <em>Cold</em> and <em>Dry</em>.</p>

	<p>To this, there are two things to be <ins class="errata" id="errata_4" title="Original reads: an-answered">answered</ins>:
	One, that he never saw the
	experience of drawing out the Butter,
	which I have done; and that when the
	<em>Chocolate</em> is made without adding any
	thing to the dryed Powder, which is incorporated,
	onely by beating it well together,
	and is united, and made into a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_7" title="7"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_B4" title="B4"></a>Paste, which is a signe, that there is a
	moist, and glutinous part, which, of necessity,
	must correspond with the Element
	of Aire.</p>

	<p>The other reason, we will draw from
	Philosophy; affirming that, in the <em>Cacao</em>,
	there are different substances. In the
	one, that is to say, in that, which is not
	so fat, it hath a greater quantity of the
	Oylie, then of the earthie Substance;
	and in the fatter part, it hath more of
	the earthy than of the Oily substance.
	In these there is Heate and Moysture in
	predominancy; and in the other, cold
	and dry.</p>

	<p>Notwithstanding that it is hard to be
	believed, that in one and the same substance,
	and so little of the <em>Cacao</em>, it can
	have substances so different: To the end
	that it may appeare more easie, clear, and
	evident, first we see it in the <em>Rubarbe</em>,
	which hath in it hot and soluble parts,
	and parts which are Binding, Cold and
	Dry, which have a vertue to strengthen,
	binde, and stop the loosenesse of the Belly:
	I say also, that he that sees and con<a class="pagenum" id="page_8" title="8"></a>siders
	the steele, so much of the nature of
	the earth, as being heavy, thick, cold, and
	dry; it seemes to be thought unproper
	for the curing of Opilations, but rather
	to be apt to encrease them; and yet it
	is given for a proper remedy against
	them.</p>

	<p>This difficulty is cleared thus, that
	though it be true, that it hath much of
	the Earthy part; yet it hath also parts
	of Sulphur, and of quick silver, which
	doe open, and disopilate; neither doth
	it so, untill it be helped by Art, as it is
	ground, stirred, and made fine, in the preparing
	of it; the Sulphurous parts, and
	those of quick-silver, being thinne,
	active, and penetrative, they mingle, at
	the last with those parts, which are Earthy
	and astringent: Insomuch, that they
	being mingled after this manner one with
	another, we cannot now say, that the
	steele is astringent, but rather, that it is
	penetrative, attenuating and opening.
	Let us prove this Doctrine by Authorities;
	and let the first be from <em>Gallen</em>, <i>l. 3.</i>
	of the qualities of Simples, <i>c. 14.</i> Where,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_9" title="9"></a>first of all he teacheth, that almost all
	those Medicines, which, to our sence,
	seeme to be <em>Simple</em>, are notwithstanding
	naturally <em>Compounded</em>, containing in
	themselves contrary qualities; and that
	is to say, a quality to expell, and to retaine;
	to incrassate, and attenuate; to rarifie,
	and to condense. Neither are we to
	wonder at it, it being understood, that in
	every fore-said Medicine, there is a quality
	to heat, and to coole; to moisten and
	to dry. And whatsoever Medicine it be,
	it hath in it, thick, and thinne parts; rare,
	and dense; soft, and hard. And in the
	fifteenth Chapter following, in the same
	Book, he puts an example of the Broth of
	a Cock, which moves the Belly; and the
	flesh hath the vertue to bind. He puts also
	the example of the <em>Aloes</em>, which if it be
	washt, looseth the Purgative vertue; or
	that which it hath, is but weake.</p>

	<p>That this differing vertue, and faculty,
	is found in divers substances, or parts of
	simple Medicaments, <em>Gallen</em> shewes
	in the first Booke of his simple Medicines,
	and the seventeenth Chapter,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_10" title="10"></a>bringing the example of Milke; in which,
	three substances are found, and separated,
	that is to say, the substance of
	Cheese, which hath the vertue to stop the
	Fluxe of the Belly; and the substance of
	Whay, which is purging; and Butter, as
	it is expressed in the said <em>Gallen</em>, <i>Cap. 15.</i>
	Also we finde in Wine which is in the
	Must, three substances, that is to say,
	earth, which is the chiefe; and a thinner
	substance, which is the flower, and may
	be called the scum, or froath: and a third
	substance which we properly call Wine;
	And every one of these substances, containes
	in it selfe divers qualities, and vertues;
	in the colour, in the smell, and in
	other Accidents.</p>

	<p><em>Aristotle</em> in the fourth Book of the Meteors
	and the first Chapter, treating of
	Putrefaction, he found the same substances;
	and in the second Chapter next following,
	where he that is curious may
	read it. And also by the Doctrine of
	<em>Galen</em>, and of <em>Aristotle</em>, divers substances
	are attributed to every of the mixt under
	one and the same forme and quantity;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_11" title="11"></a>which is very conformable to reason, if
	we consider, that every Aliment be it never
	so simple, begets, and produceth in
	the liver, foure humours, not onely differing
	in temper, but also in substance;
	and begets more or lesse of that humour,
	according as that Aliment hath more or
	fewer parts corresponding to the substance
	of that humour, which is most ingendred.
	And so in cold diseases, we give
	warme nourishment; and cold nourishment,
	in hot diseases.</p>

	<p>From which evident examples, and
	many others, which we might produce to
	this purpose, we may gather, that, when
	we grind and stir the <em>Cacao</em>, the divers
	parts, which Nature hath given it,
	doe artificially, and intimately mixe
	themselves one with another;  and so the
	unctuous, warme, and moist parts, mingled
	with the earthy (as we have said
	of the steele) represses, and leaves them
	not so binding, as they were before; but
	rather with a mediocritie, more inclining
	to the warme, and moist temper of the
	Aire, then to the cold and dry of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_12" title="12"></a>Earth; as it doth appeare when it is made
	fit to drinke; that you scarce give it two
	turnes with the Molinet when there riseth
	a fatty scumme: by which you may
	see how much it partaketh of the Oylie
	part.</p>

	<p>From which doctrine I gather, that
	the Author of <em>Marchena</em>, was in an errour,
	who, writing of <em>Chocolate</em>, saith that it
	causeth Opilations, because <em>Cacao</em> is astringent;
	as if that astriction were not
	corrected, by the intimate mixing of one
	part with another, by meanes of the
	grinding, as is said before. Besides, it
	having so many ingredients, which are
	naturally hot, it must of necessity have
	this effect; that is to say, to open, attenuate,
	and not to binde; and, indeed, there
	is no cause of bringing more examples, or
	producing more reasons, for this truth,
	then that which we see in the <em>Cacao</em> it self:
	which, if it be not stirred, and compounded,
	as aforesaid, to make the <em>Chocolate</em>.
	But eating of it, as it is in the fruite, as
	the <em>Criollas</em> eate it in the <em>Indies</em>, it doth notably
	obstruct, and cause stoppings; for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_13" title="13"></a>no other cause but this, that the divers
	substances which it containes, are not
	perfectly mingled by the mastication
	onely, but require the artificiall mixture,
	which we have spoken of before.</p>

	<p>Besides, our Adversary should have
	considered, and called to his memory,
	the first rudiments of Philosophy, that <i>à
	dicto secundum quid, ad dictum simpliciter,
	non valet consequentia</i>; As it is not
	enough to say, the Black-a-Moore is
	white, because his teeth are white; for he
	may be blacke, though he hath white
	teeth; and so it is not enough to say,
	that the <em>Cacao</em> is stopping; and therefore
	the Confection, which is made of it, is
	also stopping.</p>

	<p>The Tree, which beares this fruit, is so
	delicate; and the earth, where it growes,
	is so extreme hot, that to keepe the tree
	from being consumed by the Sun, they
	first plant other trees; and when they
	are growne up to a good height, then
	they plant the <em>Cacao</em> trees; that when it
	first shewes it selfe above the ground,
	those trees which are already growne,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_14" title="14"></a>may shelter it from the Sunne; and the
	fruit doth not grow naked, but ten or
	twelve of them are in one Gorde or Cod,
	which is of the bignesse of a greate black
	Figge, or bigger, and of the same forme,
	and colour.</p>

	<p>There are two sorts of <em>Cacao</em>; the one
	is common, which is of a gray colour,
	inclining towards red; the other is broader
	and bigger, which they call <em>Patlaxte</em>,
	and this is white, and more drying;
	whereby it causeth watchfulnesse, and
	drives away sleepe, and therefore it is not
	so usefull, as the ordinary. This shall
	suffice to be said of the <em>Cacao</em>.</p>

	<p>And as for the rest of the ingredients,
	which make our <em>Chocolaticall</em> Confection,
	there is notable variety; because
	some doe put into it black Pepper, and
	also <em>Tauasco</em><span class="sidenote">A red roote like madder.</span>; which is not proper,
	because it is so hot and dry; but
	onely for one, who hath a very cold
	Liver. And of this opinion, was a
	certaine Doctor of the University of
	<em>Mexico</em>, of whom a Religious man of
	good credit told me, that he finding the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_15" title="15"></a>ordinary round Pepper was not fit to
	bring his purpose about, and to the end,
	he might discover, whether the long red
	pepper were more proper, he made triall
	upon the liver of a Sheepe; and putting
	the ordinary pepper on one side, and the
	red pepper<span class="sidenote">Chile.</span> on the other, after 24 hours,
	the part, where the ordinary pepper lay,
	was dryed up; and the other part continued
	moist, as if nothing had bin thrown
	upon it.</p>

	<p>The Receipt of him who wrote at
	<em>Marchena</em>, is this: Of <em>Cacaos</em>, 700; of
	white Sugar, one pound and a halfe; Cinnamon,
	2. ounces; of long red pepper,
	14. of Cloves, halfe an ounce: Three
	Cods of the Logwood or Campeche
	tree; or in steade of that, the weight of
	2. Reals, or a shilling of Anniseeds; as
	much of <em>Agiote</em>, as will give the colour,
	which is about the quantity of a Hasell-nut.
	Some put in Almons, kernells of
	Nuts, and Orenge-flower-water.</p>

	<p>Concerning this Receipt I shall first
	say, This shooe will not fit every foote;
	but for those, who have diseases, or are
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_16" title="16"></a>inclining to be infirme, you may either
	adde, or take away, according to the necessity,
	and temperature of every one:
	and I hold it not amisse, that Sugar be
	put into it, when it is drunke, so that it
	be according to the quantity I shall hereafter
	set downe.  And sometimes they
	make Tablets of the Sugar, and the <em>Chocolate</em>
	together: which they doe onely to
	please the Pallats, as the Dames of <em>Mexico</em>
	doe use it; and they are there sold in
	shops, and are confected and eaten like
	other sweet-meats. For the Cloves,
	which are put into this drinke, by the
	Author aforesaid, the best Writers of
	this Composition use them not; peradventure
	upon this reason: that although
	they take away the ill savour of the
	mouth, they binde; as a learned Writer
	hath exprest in these verses:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="poem">F&oelig;torem emendat oris Cariophilia f&oelig;dum;<br />
		Constringunt ventrem, <ins class="expansion" id="expansion_1" title="Expanded: primaq;">primaque</ins> membra juvant.</p>

		<p class="poem_translation">Cloves doe perfume a stincking Breath, and Bind<br />
		The Belly: Hence the prime members comfort find.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_17" title="17"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_C" title="C"></a>And because they are binding (and hot
	and dry in the third degree) they must
	not be used, though they help the chiefe
	parts of Concoction, which are the Stomacke
	and the Liver, as appeares by the
	Verses before recited.</p>

	<p>The Huskes or Cods of Logwood, or
	Campeche, are very good, and smell like
	Fennell; and every one puts in of these,
	because they are not very hot; though <ins class="errata" id="errata_5" title="Original reads: it it">it</ins>
	excuse not the putting in of Annis-seed,
	as sayes the Author of this Receipt;
	for there is no <em>Chocolate</em> without it, because
	it is good for many cold diseases,
	being hot in the third degree; and to
	temper the coldnesse of the <em>Cacao</em>; and
	that it may appeare, it helpes the indisposition
	of Cold parts, I will cite the Verses
	of one curious in this Art:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="poem">Morbosus renes, vesicam, guttura, vulnam,<br />
		Intestina, jecur, <ins class="expansion" id="expansion_2" title="Expanded: cumq;">cumque</ins> lyene caput<br />
		Confortat, variisque Anisum subdita morbis<br />
		Membra: istud tantum vim leve semen habet.</p>

		<p class="poem_translation">The Reyns, the Bladder, throat, &amp; thing between&#8212;<br />
		Enatrailes and Liver, with the Head, and spleen<br />
		And other Parts, by <span class="note_marker">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Annis.</span> it are comforted:<br />
		So great a vertue&#8217;s in that little seed.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_18" title="18"></a>The quantity of a Nut of the <em>Achiote</em> <span class="sidenote"><ins class="errata" id="errata_6" title="Unclear in original.">Ta-asco.</ins></span> is
	too little to colour the quantity made according
	to his Receipt; and therefore, he
	that makes it, may put in it, as much as
	he thinkes fit.</p>

	<p>Those, who adde Almons, and Nuts,
	doe not ill; because they give it more
	body and substance then <em>Maiz</em> or <em>Paniso</em><span class="sidenote">A graine like Millet.</span>,
	which others use; and for my part, I
	should always put it into <em>Chocolate</em>, for
	Almonds (besides what I have said of
	them before) are moderately hot, and
	have a thinne juice; but you must not
	use new Almons, as a learned Author
	sayes in these Verses.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="poem">Dat modice calidum <ins class="expansion" id="expansion_3" title="Expanded: dulcisq;">dulcisque</ins> Amigdala succum,<br />
		Et tenuem; inducunt plurima damna nova.</p>

		<p class="poem_translation">New Almonds yeild a Hot and slender juice,<br />
		But bring new mischiefs by too often use.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And the small Nuts are not ill for
	our purpose; for they have almost the
	temper, which the Almons have; onely
	because they are dryer, they come nearer
	the temper of Choler; and doe therefore
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_19" title="19"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_C2" title="C2"></a>strengthen the Belly, and the Stomacke,
	being dryed: for so they must
	be used for the Confection; and they
	preserve the head from those vapours,
	which rise from the Belly: as it appeares
	by the said Author in these Verses.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="poem">Bilis Avellanam sequitur; sed roborat alvum<br />
		Ventris, &amp; a fumis liberat assa caput.</p>

		<p class="poem_translation">Filberds breed Chollar, Th&#8217; Belly Fortifie,<br />
		Benzoin the Head frees from Fumosity.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And therefore they are proper for such
	as are troubled with ventuosities, and
	<em>Hypochondriacall</em> vapours, which offend
	the brain, and there cause such troublesome
	dreames, and sad imaginations.</p>

	<p>Those who mixe <em>Maiz</em> or <em>Paniso</em> in the
	<em>Chocolate</em> doe very ill; because those
	graines doe beget a very melancholly
	humour: as the same Author expresseth
	in these Verses.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="poem">Crassa melancholicum præstant tibi Panica succum<br />
		Siccant, si penas membra, gelantque foris.</p>

		<p class="poem_translation">Grosse Eares of Corne have Cholorique juice (no doubt)<br />
		Which dries, if taken inward; cooles without.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page_20" title="20"></a>It is also apparantly windy; and those
	which mixe it in this <em>Confection</em>, doe it
	onely for their profit, by encreasing the
	quantity of the <em>Chocolate</em>; because every
	<em>Fanega</em> or measure of <span class="note_marker">*</span><span class="sidenote">* Maiz, or Indian Wheat</span> <em>Grani</em> containing
	about a Bushell and a halfe, is sold for
	eight shillings, and they sell this <em>Confection</em>
	for foure shillings a pound, which is
	the ordinary price of the <em>Chocolate</em>.</p>

	<p>The <em>Cinamon</em> is hot and dry in the
	third degree; it provokes Urine,
	and helps the Kidneys and Reynes of
	those who are troubled with cold diseases;
	and it is good for the eyes; and in
	effect, it is cordiall; as appeares by the
	Author of these Verses.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="poem">Commoda &amp; urinæ Cinnamomum, &amp; renibus<br />
		Lumina clarificat, dira venena fugat. <span class="keep_separate">(affert:</span></p>

		<p class="poem_translation">Cinnamon helps the Reines and Urine well,<br />
		It cleares the Eyes, and Poison doth expell.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The <em>Achiote</em> hath a piercing attenuating
	quality, as appeareth by the <ins class="expansion" id="expansion_4" title="Expanded: comm&otilde;">common</ins>
	practice of the Physitians in the <em>Indies</em>,
	experienced daily in the effects of it, who
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_21" title="21"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_C3" title="C3"></a>doe give it to their Patients, to cut, and
	attenuate the grosse humours, which doe
	cause shortnesse of breath, and stopping
	of urine; and so it may be used for any
	kind of Opilations; for we give it for the
	stoppings, which are in the breast, or in
	the Region of the belly, or any other part
	of the Body.</p>

	<p>And concerning the long red Peper,
	there are foure sorts of it. One is called
	<em>Chilchotes</em>: the other very little, which
	they call <em>Chilterpin</em>; and these two kinds,
	are very quicke and biting. The other
	two are called <em>Tonalchiles</em>, and these are
	moderately hot; for they are eaten with
	bread, as they eate other fruits, &amp; they are
	of a yellow colour; and they grow onely
	about the Townes, which are in, and adjoyning
	to the Lake of <em>Mexico</em>. The other
	Pepper is called <em>Chilpaclagua</em>, which
	hath a broad huske, and this is not so
	biting as the first; nor so gentle as the
	last, and is that, which is usually put into
	the <em>Chocolate</em>.</p>

	<p>There are also other ingredients, which
	are used in this <em>Confection</em>. One called
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_22" title="22"></a><em>Mechasuchil</em>; and another which they call
	<em>Vinecaxtli</em>, which in the <em>Spanish</em> they call
	<em>Orejuelas</em>, which are sweet smelling Flowers,
	Aromaticall and hot. And the
	<em>Mechasuchil</em> hath a Purgative quality;
	for in the <em>Indies</em> they make a purging
	portion of it. In stead of this, in <em>Spaine</em>
	they put into the <em>Confection</em>, powder of
	<em>Alexandria</em>, for opening the Belly.</p>

	<p>I have spoken of all these Ingredients,
	that every one may make choise of those
	which please him best, or are most proper
	for infirmities.</p>

	<h2 class="point_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page_23" title="23"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_C4" title="C4"></a>The second Point.</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph">As concerning the second point, I
	say, as I have said before, that
	though it be true, that the <em>Cacao</em>
	is mingled with all these Ingredients,
	which are hot; yet there is to be a
	greater quantity of <em>Cacao</em>, then of all the
	rest of the Ingredients, which serve to
	temper the coldnesse of the <em>Cacao</em>: Just
	as when we seek, of two Medicines of
	contrary qualities, to compound one,
	which shall be of a moderate temper: In
	the same manner doth result the same
	action and re-action of the cold parts of
	the <em><ins class="errata" id="errata_7" title="Original reads: Cocao">Cacao</ins></em>, and of the hot parts of the other
	ingredients, which makes the <em>Chocolate</em>
	of so moderate a quality, that it
	differs very little from a mediocrity;
	and when there is not put in any ordinary
	pepper, or Cloves, but onely a little
	Annisseed (as I shall shew hereafter) we
	may boldly say, that it is very temperate.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_24" title="24"></a>And this may be proved by reason, and
	experience: (supposing that which <em>Gallen</em>
	sayes, to be true, that every mixt Medicine,
	warmeth the cold, and cooleth the
	hot; bringing the examples of Oyle of
	<em>Roses</em>.) By experience, I say, that in the
	<em>Indies</em> (as is the custom of that countrey)
	I comming in a heat to visite a sick person,
	and asking water to refresh me, they
	perswaded mee to take a Draught of
	<em>Chocolate</em>; which quencht my thirst: &amp; in
	the morning (if I took it fasting) it did
	warme and comfort my stomack. Now
	let us prove it by reason. Wee have already
	proved, that all the parts of the
	<em>Cacao</em> are not cold. For we have made it
	appeare that the unctuous parts, which
	are many, be all hot, or temperate: then,
	though it be true, that the quantity of
	the <em>Cacao</em> is greater than of all the rest of
	the ingredients, yet the cold parts are at
	the most, not halfe so many as the hot;
	and if for all this they should be more,
	yet by stirring, &amp; mangling of the warme
	unctuous parts, they are much qualified.
	And, on the other side, it being mixt
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_25" title="25"></a>with the other Ingredients, which are hot
	in the second and third degree, being the
	predominant quality, it must needs be
	brought to a mediocrity. Like as two
	men, who shake hands, the one being hot,
	and the other cold, the one hand borrows
	heat, and the other is made colder;
	and in conclusion, neither hand retaines
	the cold, or heat it had before, but both
	of them remain more temperate. So like-wise
	two men, who go to wrestle, at the
	first they are in their full vigour and
	strength; but after they have strugled a
	while, their force lessens by degrees, till
	at last they are both much weaker, than
	when they began to wrestle. And <em>Aristotle</em>
	was also of this opinion in his fourth
	Booke of the Nature of Beasts, <i>cap. 3.</i>
	Where he sayes, that every Agent suffers
	with the patient; as that which cuts, is
	made dul by the thing it cuts; that which
	warmes, cooles it selfe; and that which
	thrusts, or forceth forward, is in some
	sort driven bake it selfe.</p>

	<p>From whence I gather, that it is better
	to use <em>Chocolate</em>, after it hath beene
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_26" title="26"></a>made some time, a Moneth at the least. I
	believe this time to be necessary, for
	breaking the contrary qualities of the severall
	Ingredients, and to bring the
	Drinke to a moderate temper.  For, as it
	alwayes falls out at the first, that every
	contrary will have its predominancy, and
	will worke his owne effects, Nature not
	liking well to be heated and cooled, at
	the same time. And this is the cause why
	<em>Gallen</em> in his twelfth Booke of <i>Method</i>,
	doth advise not to use <em>Philonium</em>, till after
	a yeare, or, at the least, six moneths;
	because it is a composition made of <em>Opium</em>
	(which is cold in the fourth degree)
	and of Pepper, and other Ingredients,
	which are hot in the third degree.  This
	Theorum, and Doctrine, is made good
	by the practise, which some have made,
	of whom I have asked, what <em>Chocolate</em>
	did best agree with them? and they have
	affirmed, that the best is that which
	hath beene made some moneths: and
	that the new doth hurt by loosening the
	Stomack; And, in my opinion, the reason
	of it is, that the unctuous or fat parts,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_27" title="27"></a>are not altogether corrected, by the earthy
	parts of the <em>Cacao</em>. And this I shall
	thus prove; for, as I shall declare hereafter,
	if you make the <em>Chocolate</em> boyle,
	when you drinke it, the boyling of it divides
	that fat and oyly part; and that
	makes a relaxation in the Stomacke in
	the old <em>Chocolate</em>, as well as if it were new.</p>

	<p>So that I conclude in this second point,
	that the <em>Chocolaticall Confection</em> is not so
	cold as the <em>Cacao</em>, nor so hot as the rest
	of the Ingredients; but there results
	from the action and re-action of these Ingredients,
	a moderate temper which
	may be good, both for the cold and hot
	stomacks, being taken moderately, as
	shall be declared hereafter; and it having
	beene made a moneth at the least; as
	is already proved. And so I know not
	why any many having made experience of
	this <em>Confection</em> (which is composed, as it
	ought to be, for every particular) should
	speake ill of it. Besides, where it is so
	much used, the most, if not all, as well
	in the <em>Indies</em>, as in <em>Spain</em>, finde, it agreeth
	well with them. He of <em>Merchena</em> had no
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_28" title="28"></a>ground in saying, that it did cause Opilations.
	For, if it were so, the Liver being
	obstructed, it would extenuate its
	subject; and by experience, we see to the
	contrary, that it makes fat; the reason
	whereof I shall shew hereafter. And this
	shall suffice for the second Point.</p>
</div>
<div id="the_third_point" class="section">
	<h2 class="point_title">The third Point.</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph">Having treated in the first poynt,
	of the definition of <em>Chocolate</em>,
	the quality of the <em>Cacao</em>, and of
	the other Ingredients; and in the second
	Point, of the Complexion, which results
	from the mixture of them; There remaines
	now in the third poynt, to shew
	the way how to mingle them: And first
	I will bring the best Receipt, and the
	most to the purpose, that I could find
	out; although it be true which I have said,
	that one Receipt cannot be given, which
	shall be proper for all; that is to be un<a class="pagenum" id="page_29" title="29"></a>derstood of those, who are sick; for those
	that are strong, and in health, this may
	serve: and for the other (as I have said in
	the conclusion of the first Poynt) every
	one may make choyse of the Ingredients,
	as they may be usefull, to this, or that
	part of his body.</p>

	<h3 class="point_subtitle">The Receipt is this.</h3>

	<p class="first_paragraph">To every 100. <em>Cacaos</em>, you must put
	two cods of the<span class="note_marker">*</span><span class="sidenote">Chiles</span> long red Pepper, of
	which I have spoken before, and are called
	in the <em>Indian</em> Tongue, <em>Chilparlagua</em>;
	and in stead of those of the <em>Indies</em>, you
	may take those of <em>Spaine</em> which are broadest,
	&amp; least hot. One handfull of Annis-seed
	<em>Orejuelas</em>, which are otherwise called
	<em>Pinacaxlidos</em>: and two of the flowers,
	called <em>Mechasuchil</em>, if the Belly be bound.
	But in stead of this, in <em>Spaine</em>, we put in
	six Roses of <em>Alexandria</em> beat to Powder:
	One Cod of <em>Campeche</em>, or Logwood:
	Two Drams of Cinamon; Almons,
	and Hasle-Nuts, of each one Dozen: Of
	white Sugar, halfe a pound: of <em>Achiote</em>
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_30" title="30"></a>enough to give it the colour. And if you
	cannot have those things, which come
	from the <em>Indies</em>, you may make it with
	the rest.</p>

	<h3 class="point_subtitle">The way of Compounding.</h3>

	<p class="first_paragraph">The <em>Cacao</em>, and the other Ingredients
	must be beaten in a Morter of Stone,
	or ground upon a broad stone, which the
	<em>Indians</em> call <em>Metate</em>, and is onely made
	for that use: But the first thing that is to
	be done, is to dry the Ingredients, all except
	the <em>Achiote</em>; with care that they
	may be beaten to powder, keeping them
	still in stirring, that they be not burnt, or
	become black; and if they be over-dried,
	they will be bitter, and lose their vertue.
	The Cinamon, and the long red Pepper
	are to be first beaten, with the Annis-seed;
	and then beate the <em>Cacao</em>, which
	you must beate by a little and little, till
	it be all powdred; and sometimes turne
	it round in the beating, that it may mixe
	the better: And every one of these Ingredients,
	must be beaten by it selfe; and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_31" title="31"></a>then put all the Ingredients into the Vessell,
	where the <em>Cacao</em> is; which you must
	stirre together with a spoone; and then
	take out that Paste, and put it into the
	Morter, under which you must lay a
	little fire, after the <em>Confection</em> is made.
	But you must be very carefull, not to put
	more fire, than will warme it, that the
	unctuous part doe not dry away. And
	you must also take care, to put in the
	<em>Achiote</em> in the beating; that it may the
	better take the colour. You must Searse
	all the Ingredients, but onely the <em>Cacao</em>;
	and if you take the shell from the <em>Cacao</em>,
	it is the better; and when you shall find it
	to be well beaten, &amp; incorporated (which
	you shall know by the shortness of it) then
	with a spoone take up some of the Paste,
	which will be almost liquid; and so either
	make it into Tablets; or put it into Boxes;
	and when it is cold it will be hard. To
	make the Tablets you must put a spoonfull
	of the Paste upon a piece of paper, the
	<em>Indians</em> put it upon the leaf of a <em>Planten-tree</em>;
	where, being put into the shade, it
	growes hard; and then bowing the paper,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_32" title="32"></a>the Tablet falls off, by reason of the fatnesse
	of the paste. But if you put it into
	any thing of earth, or wood, it sticks fast,
	and will not come off, but with scraping,
	or breaking. In the <em>Indies</em> they take it two
	severall waies: the one, being the common
	way, is to take it hot, with <em>Atolle</em>,
	which was the Drinke of Ancient <em>Indians</em>
	(the <em>Indians</em> call <em>Atolle</em> pappe, made of
	the flower of <em>Maiz</em>, and so they mingle
	it with the <em>Chocolate</em>, and that the <em>Atolle</em>
	may be more wholesome, they take off
	the Husks of the <em>Maiz</em>, which is windy,
	and melancholy; and so there remaines
	onely the best and most substantiall
	part.) Now, to returne to the matter, I
	say, that the other Moderne drinke,
	which the Spaniards use so much, is of
	two sorts. The one is, that the <em>Chocolate</em>,
	being dissolved with cold water, &amp; the
	scumme taken off, and put into another
	Vessell, the remainder is put upon the fire,
	with Sugar; and when it is warme, then
	powre it upon the Scumme you tooke off
	before, and so drinke it. The other is to
	warme the water; and then, when you
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_33" title="33"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_D" title="D"></a>have put it into a pot, or dish, as much
	<em>Chocolate</em> as you thinke fit, put in a little
	of the warme water, and then grinde it
	well with the molinet; and when it is
	well ground, put the rest of the warme
	water to it; and so drinke it with Sugar.</p>

	<p>Besides these former wayes, there is
	one other way; which is, put the <em>Chocolate</em>
	into a pipkin, with a little water;
	and let it boyle well, till it be dissolved;
	and then put in sufficient water and Sugar,
	according to the quantity of the
	<em>Chocolate</em>; and then boyle it againe, untill
	there comes an oyly scumme upon it;
	and then drinke it. But if you put too
	much fire, it will runne over, and spoyle.
	But, in my opinion, this last way is not so
	wholsome, though it pleaseth the pallate
	better; because, when the Oily is divided
	from the earthy part, which remaines at
	the bottome, it causeth Melancholy; and
	the oily part loosens the stomacke, and
	takes away the appetite: There is another
	way to drink <em>Chocolate</em>, which is cold;
	and it takes its name from the principall
	Ingredient, and is called <em>Cacao</em>; which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_34" title="34"></a>they use at feasts, to refresh themselves;
	and it is made after this manner. The
	<em>Chocolate</em> being dissolved in water with
	the <em>Molinet</em>, take off the scumme or crassy
	part, which riseth in greater quantity,
	when the <em>Cacao</em> is older, and more putrified.
	The scumme is laid aside by it selfe
	in a little dish; and then put sugar into
	that part, from whence you tooke the
	scumme; and powre it from on high into
	the scumme; and so drink it cold. And
	this drink is so cold, that it agreeth not
	with all mens stomacks; for by experience
	we find the hurt it doth, by causing
	paines in the stomacke, and especially to
	Women. I could deliver the reason of
	it; but I avoid it, because I will not be
	tedious, some use it, &amp;c.</p>

	<p>There is another way to drinke it cold,
	which is called <em>Cacao Penoli</em>; and it is
	done, by adding to the same <em>Chocolate</em>
	(having made the <em>Confection</em>, as is before
	set downe) so much <em>Maiz</em>, dryed, and
	well ground, and taken from the Huske,
	and then well mingled in the Morter,
	with the <em>Chocolate</em>, it falls all into flowre,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_35" title="35"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_D2" title="D2"></a>or dust; &amp; so these things being mingled,
	as is said before, there riseth the Scum;
	and so you take and drink it, as before.</p>

	<p>There is another way, which is a shorter
	and quicker way of making it, for
	men of businesse, who cannot stay long
	about it; and it is more wholsome; and
	it is that, which I use. That is, first to set
	some water to warm; and while it warms,
	you throw a Tablet, or some <em>Chocolate</em>,
	scraped, and mingled with sugar, into a
	little Cup; and when the water is hot, you
	powre the water to the <em>Chocolate</em>, and
	then dissolve it with the Molinet; and
	then without taking off the scum, drink
	it as is before directed.</p>
</div>
<div id="the_fourth_part" class="section">
	<h2 class="point_title">The fourth Part.</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph">There remaines to be handled in
	the last Point, of the Quantity,
	which is to be drunke: at what
	Time; and by what persons: because if
	it be drunk beyond measure, not onely of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_36" title="36"></a><em>Chocolate</em>, but of all other drinkes, or
	meates, though of themselves they are
	good and wholsome, they may be hurtfull.
	And if any finde it Opilative, it
	comes by the too much use of it; as when
	one drinkes over much Wine, in stead of
	comforting, and warming himselfe, he
	breeds, and nourisheth cold diseases; because
	Nature cannot overcome it, nor
	turne so great a quantity into good nourishment.
	So he that drinkes much <em>Chocolate</em>,
	which hath fat parts, cannot make
	distribution of so great a quantity to all
	the parts; and that part which remaines
	in the slender veines of the Liver, must
	needs cause Opilations, and Obstructions.</p>

	<p>To avoid this inconvenience; you must
	onely take five or six ounces, in the morning,
	if it be in winter; and if the party
	who takes it, be Cholerick, in stead of
	ordinary water, let him take the distilled
	water of Endive. The same reason serves
	in Summer, for those, who take it physically,
	having the Liver hot and obstructed.
	If his Liver be cold and obstructed,
	then to use the water of <em>Rubarb</em>.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_37" title="37"></a><a class="print_signature" id="signature_D3" title="D3"></a>And to conclude, you may take it till the
	Moneth of <em>May</em>, especially in temperate
	dayes. But I doe not approve, that in
	the Dogdayes it should be taken in
	<em>Spaine</em>, unlesse it be one, who by custome
	of taking it, receives no prejudice by
	it. And if he be of a hot Constitution,
	and that he have neede to take it in that
	season, let it, as is said before, be mingled
	with water of <em>Endive</em>; and once in foure
	dayes, and chiefely when he findes his
	stomacke in the morning to be weake
	and fainting. And though it be true,
	that, in the <em>Indies</em>, they use it all the yeare
	long, it being a very hot Countrey, and
	so it may seeme by the same reason it
	may be taken in <em>Spaine</em>: First, I say, that
	Custome may allow it: Secondly, that
	as there is an extraordinary proportion
	of heate, so there is also of moisture;
	which helpes, with the exorbitant heat,
	to open the pores; and so dissipates, and
	impoverisheth our substance, or naturall
	vigor: by reason whereof, not only in
	the morning, but at any time of the day,
	they use it without prejudice. And this
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_38" title="38"></a>is most true, that the excessive heate of
	the Country, drawes out the naturall
	heate, and disperseth that of the stomack
	and of the inward parts: Insomuch that
	though the weather be never so hot, yet
	the stomack being cold, it usually doth
	good. I do not onely say this of the <em>Chocolate</em>,
	which, as I have proved, hath a
	moderate heate; But if you drinke pure
	wine, be the weather never so hot, it hurts
	not, but rather comforts the stomack;
	and if in hot weather you drinke water,
	the hurt it doth is apparant, in that it
	cooles the stomack too much; from
	whence comes a viciated Concoction,
	and a thousand other inconveniences.</p>

	<p>You must also observe, that it being
	granted, as I have said, that there are earthy
	parts in the <em>Cacao</em>, which fall to the
	bottome of the Cup, when you make the
	drinke, divers are of the opinion, that,
	that which remaines, is the best and the
	more substantiall; and they hurt themselves
	not a litle, by drinking of it. For
	besides, that it is an earthy substance,
	thick, and stopping, it is of a malancho<a class="pagenum" id="page_39" title="39"></a>ly Nature; and therefore you must avoid
	the drinking of it, contenting your selfe
	with the best, which is the most substantiall.</p>

	<p>Last of all, there rests one difficulty to
	be resolved, formerly poynted at; namely,
	what is the cause, why <em>Chocolate</em> makes
	most of them that drinke it, fat. For considering
	that all of the Ingredients, except
	the <em>Cacao</em>, do rather extenuate, than
	make fat, because they are hot and dry in
	the third degree. For we have already
	said, that the qualities which do predominate
	in <em>Cacao</em>, are cold, and dry; which
	are very unfit to adde any substance to
	the body. Neverthelesse, I say, that the
	many unctuous parts, which I have proved
	to be in the <em>Cacao</em>, are those, which
	pinguifie, and make fat; and the hotter
	ingredients of this Composition, serve
	for a guide, or vehicall, to passe to the
	Liver, and the other parts, untill they
	come to the fleshy parts; and there finding
	a like substance, which is hot and
	moyst, as is the unctuous part, converting
	it selfe into the same substance, it doth
	<a class="pagenum" id="page_40" title="40"></a>augment and pinguifie. Much more
	might be said from the ground of Philosophy,
	and Physique; but because that
	is fitter for the Schooles, than for this discourse;
	I leave it, and onely give this
	Caution, that in my Receipt, you may
	adde Mellon seeds, and seeds of Pompions
	of <em>Valencia</em>, dryed, and beaten into
	powder, where there is any heat of the
	Liver or Kidnyes. And if there be any
	obstructions of the Liver, or Spleene,
	with any cold distemper, you may mixe
	the powder of <em>Ceterach</em>; to which you
	may adde Amber, or Muske, to please the
	scent.</p>

	<p>And it will be no small matter, to have
	pleased all, with this Discourse.</p>

	if you please make your <em>Chocolate</em> with
	Water and Sugar, working it after the same
	order with your <em>Molenillo</em>, which for some
	weake stomacks may chance to be better
	liked. And many there be that beat Almonds,
	and strayne them into the water it is boyled,
	and wrought with the <em>Chocolate</em> and Sugar:
	others like to put the yelkes of eggs as
	before in the milke, and even sweeten it
	with Sugar to your taste: If you drinke a
	good draught of this in a morning, you may
	travell all the day without any other thing,
	this is so Substantiall and Cordiall.</p>

	<h2 class="section_title">The manner of making <em>Chocolate</em>.</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph">Set a Pot of Conduit Water over
	the fire untill it boiles, then to every
	person that is to drink, put an ounce
	of <em>Chocolate</em>, with as much Sugar into
	another Pot; wherein you must poure a
	pint of the said boiling Water, and
	therein mingle the <em>Chocolate</em> and the Sugar,
	with the instrument called <em>El Molinillo</em>,
	untill it be thoroughly incorporated:
	which done, poure in as many halfe pints
	of the said Water as there be ounces of
	<em>Chocolate</em>, and if you please, you may
	put in one or two yelks of fresh Eggs,
	which must be beaten untill they froth
	very much; the hotter it is drunke, the
	better it is, being cold it may doe harme.
	You may likewise put in a slice of white
	bred or Bisquet, and eate that with the
	<em>Chocolate</em>. The newer and fresher made
	it is, the more benefit you shall finde by
	it; that which comes from forreigne
	parts, and is stale, is not so good as that
	which is made here.</p>
